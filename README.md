- 👋 Hi, I’m @AJLee210, just call me 'AJ'.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and data science although my original major was civil engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning environmental data science in colorado state university. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone interested in data science for your growth and for me. I am a really beginner in this field. 
- 📫 How to reach me is through GitHub or by emailing me at "AJ.Lee@colostate.edu". I hope to see you in the endless sea of data.
